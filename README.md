#Franchise Expansion Project
Overview
In today's competitive business landscape, strategic expansion is essential for the success of franchises. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to perform a comprehensive market analysis of a specific city. The analysis helps assess the market's potential and identify the target customer base, leading to informed decisions on the optimal locations for new franchise outlets.

#Project Objectives
Market Analysis: Using machine learning algorithms, we conduct a detailed analysis of the city's market to identify key factors influencing franchise success.
Target Customer Identification: We identify the target customer base using data-driven insights, enabling us to tailor our offerings to the right audience.
Site Selection: We use machine learning to find the most optimal locations for new franchise outlets, focusing on maximizing profitability while minimizing risks.

#Machine Learning Techniques
This project employs the following machine learning algorithms:

Random Forest: Used for predicting the success of potential locations based on various market factors.
K-Means Clustering: Used for segmenting the customer base into different groups, helping to identify the target customers.
Linear Regression: Applied to forecast future sales growth and market trends in the selected locations.

#Project Structure
The project repository is structured as follows:

data/: Contains the datasets (franchise_expansion.csv and growth.csv) used in the analysis.
